First Time Diving into Game Development

Hi! Hello Again Everyone!!!
This is my first time doing a game project (NOTE: The Game is UNFINISHED)

Why it's not done?
It's because I'm doing this just out of curiosity and I haven't got any time to continue this project 
because I'm a Student too.


Where do I learn?
I'm watching tutorial on youtube, but I forgot about the creator.

About the Art
Yes, I make them myself using piskel. That's a very useful website to make a pixel art.

What do I use?
- Phyton
- Pytorch (python Library)
- Piskel (Pixel Art)

Note: If you don't want to make the art, I think you can get it from pixilart, or other online platform.
