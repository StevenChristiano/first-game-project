First Time Diving into Game Development

Hi! Hello Again Everyone!!!
This is my first time doing a game project (NOTE: The Game is UNFINISHED)

Background
I make this platform-game project purely because I love pixel-arted game, and it's very nostalgic to play a game from your childhood.

Why it's not done?
It's because I'm doing this just out of curiosity and I haven't got any time to continue this project 
because I'm a Student too.

Learning Outcomes:  
This project has enhanced my understanding of game mechanics, pytorch library, and art-making. 
I plan to expand it by adding more advanced levels and polish the overall design.

What's Finished:
- Game Physics
- Player Control (jump, move)

What's still need to work on:
- Respawn features
- Object of the game


Where do I learn?
I'm watching tutorial on youtube, but I forgot about the creator.

About the Art
Yes, I make them myself using piskel. That's a very useful website to make a pixel art.

What do I use?
- Phyton
- Pygame (python Library)
- Piskel (Pixel Art), You can use asperite but that option is not for free.

Note: If you don't want to make the art, I think you can get it from pixilart, or other online platform.
